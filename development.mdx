description: 'Set up your local development environment for Hookpulse integrations'
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 18 or higher (or Python 3.8+)
  - A Hookpulse account with API access
  - Your API key and brand UUID from the dashboard
</Info>

This guide will help you set up your local development environment to build integrations with the Hookpulse API.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Get your API credentials

You need two credentials for API authentication:

**Brand UUID:**
1. Log in to your [Hookpulse dashboard](https://hookpulse.io/signin)
2. Add a brand (if you haven't already)
3. The brand UUID will be displayed in the UI
4. Copy and store your brand UUID securely

**API Key:**
1. Select your brand from the dashboard
2. Navigate to **API Keys** section
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Add a node and you will receive your API Key
5. Click **View** on the same card to see your API Key
6. Copy and store your API key securely

<Warning>
Never share these credentials with anyone. Never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
HOOKPULSE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HOOKPULSE_BRAND_UUID=your_brand_uuid_here
HOOKPULSE_API_URL=https://api.hookpulse.io
```

### Step 3: Test your connection

Test your API connection with a simple request:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.hookpulse.io/v1/api/resources \
  -H "x-hookpulse-api-key: $HOOKPULSE_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-brand-uuid: $HOOKPULSE_BRAND_UUID"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api.hookpulse.io/v1/api/resources', {
  headers: {
    'x-hookpulse-api-key': process.env.HOOKPULSE_API_KEY,
    'x-brand-uuid': process.env.HOOKPULSE_BRAND_UUID
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

headers = {
    'x-hookpulse-api-key': os.getenv('HOOKPULSE_API_KEY'),
    'x-brand-uuid': os.getenv('HOOKPULSE_BRAND_UUID')
}

response = requests.get('https://api.hookpulse.io/v1/api/resources', headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

</CodeGroup>


## Rate limiting

During development, be mindful of rate limits:

- **Standard tier**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Pro tier**: 10000 requests per hour

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Webhook testing

For local webhook testing, use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Then configure your webhook URL in the dashboard to point to your ngrok URL.

## Best practices

- **Use environment variables** for API keys and configuration
- **Handle errors gracefully** - check response status codes
- **Implement retry logic** for transient failures
- **Log requests** for debugging (but never log API keys)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized error">

    - Verify your API key and brand UUID are correct
    - Check that both headers are included: `x-hookpulse-api-key` and `x-brand-uuid`
    - Ensure your API key hasn't expired or been revoked
    - Verify you're using the correct brand UUID for your selected brand
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Rate limit exceeded">
  
    - Check the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to see remaining requests
    - Implement exponential backoff for retries
    - Consider upgrading your plan for higher rate limits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
  
    - Verify your webhook URL is accessible from the internet
    - Check that your endpoint returns a 200 status code
    - Review webhook logs in the dashboard for delivery status
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
