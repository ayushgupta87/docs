## Get started in three steps

Start integrating with Hookpulse in just a few minutes. Follow these steps to make your first API call.

### Step 1: Get your API credentials

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Create an account">
    If you don't have a Hookpulse account yet, [sign up](https://hookpulse.io/signin) to get started.
    
    Once you've created your account, you'll be able to access your API credentials from the dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Get your credentials">
    You need two credentials for API authentication:
    
    **Brand UUID:**
    1. Log in to your [Hookpulse dashboard](https://hookpulse.io/signin)
    2. Add a brand (if you haven't already)
    3. The brand UUID will be displayed in the UI
    
    **API Key:**
    1. Select your brand from the dashboard
    2. Navigate to **API Keys** section
    3. Click **Create API Key**
    4. Add a node and you will receive your API Key
    5. Click **View** on the same card to see your API Key
    
    <Warning>Never share these credentials with anyone. Keep them secret and never commit them to version control.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Make your first API call

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Using cURL">
    Test the API with a simple cURL request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.hookpulse.io/v1/api/resources \
  -H "x-hookpulse-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-brand-uuid: YOUR_BRAND_UUID"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_BRAND_UUID` with your actual credentials from Step 1.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="code" title="Using JavaScript">
    Here's a simple example using JavaScript:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.hookpulse.io/v1/api/resources', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'x-hookpulse-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'x-brand-uuid': 'YOUR_BRAND_UUID',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="code" title="Using Python">
    Here's a simple example using Python:

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'x-hookpulse-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'x-brand-uuid': 'YOUR_BRAND_UUID',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.hookpulse.io/v1/api/resources', headers=headers)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
