# HookPulse Overview

## What is HookPulse?

**HookPulse** is a production-ready, enterprise-grade serverless task scheduling infrastructure designed for modern developers building AI agents, event-driven systems, and SaaS applications. Built on **Elixir/OTP** for unmatched reliability and performance, HookPulse eliminates the need to build and maintain complex scheduling infrastructure like Celery, Redis, or Sidekiq.

### The Problem We Solve

Building reliable task scheduling infrastructure is hard. Most developers end up:
- Spending 20+ hours/month maintaining Redis, Celery, or Sidekiq workers
- Dealing with infrastructure complexity, scaling issues, and reliability concerns
- Paying high costs for self-hosted solutions (often 95% more expensive)
- Struggling with timezone handling, precise timing, and concurrency management

**HookPulse solves all of this** with a simple HTTP API that works with any programming language.

## Core Capabilities

### 🎯 **Precise Webhook & API Scheduling**

Schedule webhooks and API calls with **millisecond precision** using multiple scheduling strategies:

- **Interval Scheduling**: Run tasks every X seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months
- **Cron Scheduling**: Industry-standard cron expressions with IANA timezone support (500+ timezones)
- **Solar Scheduling**: Trigger tasks at sunrise, sunset, or other solar events using geographic coordinates
- **Clocked Scheduling**: One-time scheduled executions at specific dates/times
- **Debounce Scheduling**: Prevent rapid-fire executions with configurable debounce logic
- **Schedule Rules**: Advanced rule engine with time windows, calendar windows, exclusions, and termination conditions

**See [Scheduling Overview](/docs/api-reference/scheduling/overview)** for complete documentation.

### 🔄 **Advanced Workflow Orchestration**

Build complex, multi-step workflows with enterprise features:

- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows
- **FIFO Sequential Mode**: Strict First-In-First-Out ordering for critical workflows with full variable support
- **Concurrent Mode**: Parallel execution for independent operations
- **Conditional Execution**: Route execution based on field values and operators (eq, ne, lt, gt, lte, gte, in, contains)
- **Failure Handling**: Stop on failure or continue execution with configurable retry strategies
- **Retry Strategies**: Retry from initial step or resume from failed step
- **Human Approval**: Pause workflows for manual approval steps with native support
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic variable substitution with system secrets (`{{ #key }}`), step responses (`{{ step.response.variable }}`), and initial context (`{{ initial.variable }}`)

**See [Workflow Template Overview](/docs/api-reference/workflow-template/overview)** for complete documentation.

### 🛡️ **Enterprise-Grade Features**

**Traffic Guard Layer** - Protect your infrastructure with built-in controls:

## Template Variables

HookPulse supports powerful template variables across webhook templates and workflow steps:

### System Secrets
Use `{{ #key }}` to inject secrets from the System Secret Vault at runtime:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{ #api_key }}"
  }
}
```

### Workflow Step Responses
Use `{{ step.response.variable }}` to access responses from previous workflow steps:
```json
{
  "body": {
    "user_id": "{{ step.response.user_id }}"
  }
}
```

### Initial Context
Use `{{ initial.variable }}` to access variables passed when scheduling:
```json
{
  "body": {
    "report_type": "{{ initial.report_type }}"
  }
}
```

**See individual overview pages** for detailed documentation on template variables.

## Best Practices
