## The Problem We Solve

Building reliable task scheduling infrastructure is one of the most complex challenges in modern software development. VP Engineering and platform engineering teams consistently identify this as a critical pain point. Most engineering teams struggle with:

### Infrastructure Complexity

- **Redis Clusters**: Managing Redis for job queues requires constant monitoring, scaling, and maintenance
- **Worker Processes**: Celery, Sidekiq, or custom workers need deployment, scaling, and failure handling
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, SQS, or Kafka add operational overhead and complexity
- **Cron Servers**: Traditional cron jobs lack reliability, monitoring, and error handling

### Hidden Costs

- **Development Time**: Teams spend 20+ hours/month maintaining scheduling infrastructure
- **Operational Overhead**: DevOps resources dedicated to monitoring, scaling, and troubleshooting
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Self-hosted solutions cost 95% more than managed alternatives
- **Opportunity Cost**: Time spent on infrastructure instead of building product features

### Reliability Challenges

- **Timezone Handling**: Precise scheduling across 500+ IANA timezones is complex
- **Failure Recovery**: Retry logic, error handling, and dead letter queues require careful implementation
- **Concurrency Control**: Preventing system overload while maximizing throughput
- **Monitoring**: Tracking execution success, latency, and failures across distributed systems

**HookPulse eliminates all of this complexity** with a simple HTTP API that works with any programming language.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Elixir/OTP? Why is this important?

Elixir/OTP is the most reliable technology stack for distributed systems. It's battle-tested at scale:
- **WhatsApp**: 100+ billion messages daily, 99.9% uptime
- **Discord**: 150+ million users, 8+ billion events per day
- **Pinterest**: Billions of pins processed reliably

Elixir/OTP provides fault tolerance, concurrency, and hot code swapping that's impossible with traditional stacks (Python, Node.js, Ruby). When you choose HookPulse, you're choosing the same reliability architecture that powers these world-class systems.

### How does HookPulse compare to Celery/Redis?

HookPulse eliminates the need for Celery workers, Redis clusters, and message queues entirely. Comparison:

| Aspect | HookPulse | Celery + Redis |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Setup Time | 5 minutes | 2-3 days |
| Monthly Cost | $1.18 base | $200-500+ |
| Maintenance | 0 hours | 20+ hours |
| Reliability | 99.9% SLA | Your responsibility |
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual |

You get the same functionality via HTTP API without managing infrastructure. It's 95% cheaper and saves 20+ hours/month in maintenance.

### What happens if HookPulse goes down?

HookPulse runs on Google Cloud with multi-region redundancy and 99.9% uptime SLA. Built on Elixir/OTP's fault-tolerant architecture:
- Individual process failures don't affect the system (supervision trees)
- Automatic failover between regions
- Hot code swapping allows updates without downtime
- Transparent status reporting

We provide transparent status reporting and automatic failover. The Elixir/OTP architecture ensures that even if individual components fail, the system continues operating.

### Can I use HookPulse with my existing stack?

Yes! HookPulse works with any programming language and any infrastructure. It's just HTTP API calls—no special libraries or dependencies required. Works with:
- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Node.js (Express, Next.js, NestJS)
- Ruby (Rails, Sinatra)
- Go (any framework)
- Java (Spring, Micronaut)
- PHP (Laravel, Symfony)
- And any language that supports HTTP

### How do I handle timezones?

HookPulse supports all 500+ IANA timezones with automatic DST (Daylight Saving Time) handling. Simply specify the timezone when creating schedules, and HookPulse handles:
- Automatic DST transitions
- Timezone conversions
- Precise scheduling across global applications

No manual timezone math required—HookPulse handles it all automatically.

### What about security?

Enterprise-grade security:
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **HTTPS-Only Webhooks**: All webhook deliveries use secure HTTPS connections
- **HMAC Verification**: Optional HMAC signature verification for webhook security
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for team management
- **Audit Logs**: Complete audit trail of all API operations
- **SOC 2 Ready**: Infrastructure designed for SOC 2 Type II compliance

### Can I self-host HookPulse?

HookPulse is a managed service. This ensures you always have:
- Latest features and improvements
- Security patches and updates
- Reliability improvements
- Zero operational overhead

Self-hosting would require maintaining Elixir/OTP infrastructure, which defeats the purpose of eliminating infrastructure complexity.

### What's the difference between HookPulse and cron?

Traditional cron is limited:
- **Precision**: Minute-level vs. HookPulse's millisecond precision
- **Reliability**: No retry logic vs. HookPulse's configurable retries
- **Monitoring**: No visibility vs. HookPulse's comprehensive dashboards
- **Timezone**: Manual handling vs. HookPulse's 500+ timezone support
