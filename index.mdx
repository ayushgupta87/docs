# HookPulse Overview

## What is HookPulse?

**HookPulse** is a production-ready, enterprise-grade serverless task scheduling infrastructure designed for modern developers building AI agents, event-driven systems, and SaaS applications. Built on **Elixir/OTP** for unmatched reliability and performance, HookPulse eliminates the need to build and maintain complex scheduling infrastructure like Celery, Redis, or Sidekiq.

### The Problem We Solve

Building reliable task scheduling infrastructure is hard. Most developers end up:
- Spending 20+ hours/month maintaining Redis, Celery, or Sidekiq workers
- Dealing with infrastructure complexity, scaling issues, and reliability concerns
- Paying high costs for self-hosted solutions (often 95% more expensive)
- Struggling with timezone handling, precise timing, and concurrency management

**HookPulse solves all of this** with a simple HTTP API that works with any programming language.

## Core Capabilities

### 🎯 **Precise Webhook & API Scheduling**

Schedule webhooks and API calls with **millisecond precision** using multiple scheduling strategies:

- **Interval Scheduling**: Run tasks every X seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months
- **Cron Scheduling**: Industry-standard cron expressions with IANA timezone support
- **Solar Scheduling**: Trigger tasks at sunrise/sunset with geographic coordinates
- **Clocked Scheduling**: One-time scheduled executions at specific dates/times

### 🔄 **Workflow Orchestration**

Build complex, multi-step workflows with conditional execution:

- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows
- **Payload Transformation**: Transform data between workflow steps
- **Conditional Logic**: Route execution based on conditions
- **Template Library**: Reusable workflow templates for common patterns
- **Workflow Visualization**: Interactive graphs showing data flow and step connections

### 🛡️ **Enterprise-Grade Features**

**Traffic Guard Layer** - Protect your infrastructure:

- **Rate Limiting**: Set max requests per second per project
- **Concurrency Control**: Limit concurrent executions to prevent overload
- **FIFO Queues**: Strict First-In-First-Out ordering for critical workflows
- **Idempotency Keys**: Prevent duplicate executions from network retries
- **Backpressure Logic**: Automatically pause queues when limits are hit

### 🌍 **Multi-Timezone Support**

- Full **IANA timezone** support (500+ timezones)
- Automatic timezone conversion for all scheduled times
- Timezone-aware scheduling for global applications

### 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring & Analytics**

- **Live Concurrency Meter**: Real-time view of concurrent executions
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed logs with pagination for all executions
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitor execution success rates over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency tracking, retry counts, and response status codes

# API Reference

## Overview

Welcome to the HookPulse API reference. This documentation provides detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

The HookPulse API is RESTful and uses JSON for request and response payloads. All API requests must be authenticated using custom headers (`x-hookpulse-api-key` and `x-brand-uuid`).

<Card
  title="OpenAPI Specification"
  icon="file-code"
  href="/api-reference/openapi.json"
>
  Download the complete OpenAPI specification file
</Card>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.hookpulse.io
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using two custom headers. Include both headers in every request:

```bash
x-hookpulse-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
x-brand-uuid: YOUR_BRAND_UUID
```

<Warning>
**Never share these credentials with anyone.** Keep your API key and brand UUID secure. Never expose them in client-side code or commit them to version control. If your credentials are compromised, regenerate them immediately from your dashboard.
</Warning>

### Getting your credentials

#### Brand UUID (`x-brand-uuid`)

1. Log in to your [Hookpulse dashboard](https://hookpulse.io/signin)
2. Add a brand (if you haven't already)
3. The brand UUID will be displayed in the UI
4. Copy and securely store your brand UUID

#### API Key (`x-hookpulse-api-key`)

1. Log in to your [Hookpulse dashboard](https://hookpulse.io/signin)
2. Select your brand from the dashboard
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Add a node and you will receive your API Key
6. The API Key will be displayed on the same card - click **View** to see it
7. Copy and securely store your API key

<Note>
Both the API key and brand UUID are required for all API requests. Make sure to include both headers in every request.
</Note>

## Rate limits

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard tier**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Pro tier**: 10000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Response format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

### Success response

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Error response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "The request is invalid",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

## HTTP status codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `204` - No Content
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
