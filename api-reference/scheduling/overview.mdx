title: 'Scheduling Overview'

HookPulse provides powerful, out-of-the-box scheduling capabilities that allow you to automate workflows and webhooks at specific times, intervals, or based on solar events. With a flexible rule engine, you can create complex scheduling patterns with exclusions, time windows, and termination conditions.

## What Is Scheduling?

Scheduling in HookPulse allows you to automatically trigger workflows or webhooks based on:
- **Time-based schedules** (intervals, cron expressions, specific clock times)
- **Solar events** (sunrise, sunset, dawn, dusk)
- **Rule-based exclusions** (specific dates, days, months, time windows)
- **Termination conditions** (maximum runs, expiration dates)

Schedules are associated with workflows or webhooks and execute automatically according to your configuration.

## Scheduling Types

### 1. Interval Scheduling

Execute workflows/webhooks at regular intervals:

- **Interval Value**: Number of units (e.g., 5)
- **Interval Period**: Unit of time (`second`, `minute`, `hour`)
- **Is One-Off Task**: Set to `true` for one-time execution, `false` for recurring
- **Examples**: Every 5 minutes, every 2 hours, every 30 seconds

**Use Cases:**
- Periodic data synchronization
- Health checks
- Regular reports
- Cache refresh
- One-time delayed execution

**Example (Recurring):**
```
Interval: 15 minutes
Is One-Off Task: false
Triggers: 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45, 13:00...
```

**Example (One-Time):**
```
Interval: 5 minutes
Is One-Off Task: true
Triggers: Once after 5 minutes, then completes
```

### 2. Cron Scheduling

Execute workflows/webhooks using cron expressions:

- **Cron Expression**: Standard cron syntax (e.g., `0 9 * * *` for daily at 9 AM)
- **Timezone**: Specify timezone for accurate execution
- **Is One-Off Task**: Set to `true` for one-time execution, `false` for recurring
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex time patterns

**Building Complex Cron Jobs:**

To build complex cron expressions easily, HookPulse provides a **Cron Expression Builder** in the Dashboard. Navigate to **Add Schedule** in your dashboard and use the out-of-the-box visual cron job builder to create complex cron expressions without manual syntax knowledge. The visual builder generates proper cron expressions that you can use via API or directly in the dashboard.

**Use Cases:**
- Daily reports at specific times
- Weekly maintenance tasks
- Monthly data processing
- Complex recurring schedules
- One-time scheduled execution

**Example (Recurring):**
```
Cron: 0 9 * * 1-5 (Every weekday at 9 AM)
Timezone: America/New_York
Is One-Off Task: false
```

**Example (One-Time):**
```
Cron: 0 9 1 1 * (January 1st at 9 AM)
Timezone: America/New_York
Is One-Off Task: true
```

### 3. Clocked Scheduling

Execute workflows/webhooks at a specific date and time:

- **Clocked Run At**: Exact datetime for execution
- **Timezone**: Timezone for the scheduled time
- **One-Off Task**: Automatically one-off (always executes once)

**Use Cases:**
- One-time scheduled tasks
- Future-dated operations
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Time-specific events

**Note:** Clocked schedules are automatically one-off tasks. The `is_one_off_task` field is not required for clocked schedules as they always execute once and then complete.

**Example:**
```
Clocked Run At: 2024-12-25 00:00:00
Timezone: UTC
Type: Automatically one-off (no is_one_off_task field needed)
```

### 4. Solar Scheduling

Execute workflows/webhooks based on solar events:

- **Solar Events**: sunrise, sunset, civil_dawn, civil_dusk, nautical_dawn, nautical_dusk, astronomical_dawn, astronomical_dusk
- **Latitude/Longitude**: Geographic coordinates for accurate calculations
- **Offset Seconds**: Optional offset to adjust timing
- **Is One-Off Task**: Set to `true` for one-time execution, `false` for recurring

**Use Cases:**
- Outdoor lighting control
- Solar panel management
- Weather-dependent operations
- Location-based automation
- One-time solar event triggers

**Example (Recurring):**
```
Solar Event: sunrise
Latitude: 40.7128
Longitude: -74.0060
Offset: +1800 seconds (30 minutes after sunrise)
Is One-Off Task: false
```

**Example (One-Time):**
```
Solar Event: sunset
Latitude: 40.7128
Longitude: -74.0060
Offset: 0 seconds
Is One-Off Task: true
```

### 5. Debounce Scheduling

Execute workflows/webhooks with debounce logic:

- **Debounce Seconds**: Delay before execution (1 to 86,400 seconds)
- **Prevents Rapid Triggers**: Waits for a quiet period before executing
- **Useful for**: Event-driven workflows that need to wait for activity to settle

**Use Cases:**
- User activity monitoring
- File upload processing
- Form submission handling
- Event aggregation

## Rule Engine

HookPulse's powerful rule engine allows you to add conditions and exclusions to your schedules:

### Time Window Rules

Restrict execution to specific time ranges:

- **Start Time**: Beginning of allowed time window
- **End Time**: End of allowed time window
- **Timezone**: Timezone for the time window

**Example:**
```
Rule: Time Window
Start: 09:00
End: 17:00
Timezone: America/New_York
Result: Only executes between 9 AM and 5 PM EST
```

### Calendar Window Rules

Restrict execution to specific days and months:

- **Allow Days**: Array of day numbers (1-31)
- **Allow Months**: Array of month numbers (1-12)

**Example:**
```
Rule: Calendar Window
Allow Days: [1, 15] (1st and 15th of month)
Allow Months: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] (All months)
Result: Executes on 1st and 15th of every month
```

### Solar Window Rules

Restrict execution to solar event windows:

- **Solar Start Event**: Beginning solar event
- **Solar End Event**: Ending solar event
- **Latitude/Longitude**: Coordinates for calculations

**Example:**
```
Rule: Solar Window
Start Event: civil_dawn
End Event: civil_dusk
Latitude: 40.7128
Longitude: -74.0060
Result: Only executes during daylight hours
```

### Exclusion Rules

Exclude specific dates from execution:

- **Exclusion Dates**: Array of dates to skip

**Example:**
```
Rule: Exclusion
Exclusion Dates: [2024-12-25, 2025-01-01]
Result: Skips execution on Christmas and New Year's Day
```

### Termination Rules

Automatically stop schedules after conditions are met:

- **Max Runs**: Maximum number of times to execute
- **Expire At**: Specific date/time to stop execution

**Example:**
```
Rule: Termination
Max Runs: 100
Result: Stops after 100 executions

OR

Rule: Termination
Expire At: 2025-12-31 23:59:59
Result: Stops at end of year
```

## Schedule Status

Schedules can have different statuses:

- **active**: Schedule is running and executing
- **inactive**: Schedule is disabled
- **paused**: Schedule is temporarily paused
- **completed**: Schedule has completed (one-off tasks)
- **expired**: Schedule has expired (termination rule met)

## Template Variables in Schedules

Schedules support template variables in their initial context:

- **System Secrets**: `{{ #key }}` - Access secrets from vault
- **Variables**: `{{ variable }}` - Pass dynamic values
- **Initial Context**: Variables available to the workflow/webhook when scheduled
