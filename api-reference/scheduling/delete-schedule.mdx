## Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `schedule_uuid` | string | Yes | UUID of the schedule to delete |

## Example response

<ResponseExample>

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "error": "Schedule deleted successfully"
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Indicates if the schedule was deleted successfully |
| `error` | string | Success message indicating the schedule was deleted |

## Error Responses

If the schedule is not found or cannot be deleted, you will receive an error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Schedule not found"
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Permanent Deletion**: Deleting a schedule is permanent and cannot be undone
- **Associated Rules**: All rules associated with the schedule will also be deleted
- **Active Schedules**: You can delete schedules regardless of their status (active, paused, inactive, etc.)
- **No Impact on Targets**: Deleting a schedule does not delete the webhook or workflow template it was scheduling

## Use Cases

- **Cleanup**: Remove old or unused schedules
- **Error Recovery**: Delete incorrectly configured schedules
- **Resource Management**: Remove schedules that are no longer needed
- **Testing**: Clean up test schedules after development

## Examples

  "schedule_uuid": "81646be2-ae5f-49f8-b253-ce87fe73be63"
}
```
