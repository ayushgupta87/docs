Hookpulse sends webhook events to your configured endpoint when resources are created, updated, or deleted.

## Setup

1. Navigate to your [webhook settings](https://hookpulse.io/signin) in the dashboard
2. Click "Add Webhook"
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Select the events you want to receive
5. Save your webhook configuration

## Webhook signature

All webhook requests include a signature header for verification:
