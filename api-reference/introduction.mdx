## Overview

Welcome to the Hookpulse API reference. This documentation provides detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

The Hookpulse API is RESTful and uses JSON for request and response payloads. All API requests must be authenticated using custom headers (`x-hookpulse-api-key` and `x-brand-uuid`).

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.hookpulse.io
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using two custom headers. Include both headers in every request:

```bash
x-hookpulse-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
x-brand-uuid: YOUR_BRAND_UUID
```

<Warning>
**Never share these credentials with anyone.** Keep your API key and brand UUID secure. Never expose them in client-side code or commit them to version control. If your credentials are compromised, regenerate them immediately from your dashboard.
</Warning>

### Getting your credentials

#### Brand UUID (`x-brand-uuid`)

1. Log in to your [Hookpulse dashboard](https://hookpulse.io/signin)
2. Add a brand (if you haven't already)
3. The brand UUID will be displayed in the UI
4. Copy and securely store your brand UUID

#### API Key (`x-hookpulse-api-key`)

1. Log in to your [Hookpulse dashboard](https://hookpulse.io/signin)
2. Select your brand from the dashboard
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Add a node and you will receive your API Key
6. The API Key will be displayed on the same card - click **View** to see it
7. Copy and securely store your API key

<Note>
Both the API key and brand UUID are required for all API requests. Make sure to include both headers in every request.
</Note>

## Rate limits

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard tier**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Pro tier**: 10000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Response format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

### Success response

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Error response

All endpoints use a consistent error format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "ERROR_MESSAGE_HERE"
}
```

## HTTP status codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using `limit` and `offset` query parameters:

```bash
GET /resources?limit=20&offset=0
```

Response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 100,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Hookpulse supports webhooks for real-time event notifications. See the [webhook documentation](/api-reference/endpoint/webhook) for setup instructions.
